# **Arduino UNO Weather Monitor Project for Biomedical Class**

## Description

This is a project I made for my biomedical science class. We were assigned with the task of making any product or presentation that shows our career interests, biomedical or not. While I am not interested in meteorology or weather, I am interested in electrical engineering and programming. This project allowed me to display my interests by creating a practical device. 

This device may also be used in the biomedical field (the concept of it at least) to help get the specifics of data. It can sense temperature, humidity, and even water levels.

The water sensor may be used to test quality of water and the conductivity, since not all water is the same. Possibly other liquids too.

Note: This is my first time doing any of this stuff, so I am new to the design patterns in Fritzing and Arduino wiring.

Note: The IR sensor takes 11 and LCD takes 13 because I switched them to debug something, I might fix it later.
