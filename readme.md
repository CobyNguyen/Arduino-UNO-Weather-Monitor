# Arduino UNO Weather Monitor Projectfor Biomedical Class

## Description
This is a project I made for my biomedical science class. We were assigned with the task of making any product or presentation that shows our career interests, biomedical or not. While I am not interested in meterology or weather, I am interested in electrical engineering and programming. This project allowed me to display my intersts by creating a practical device. 

This device may also be used in the biomedical field (obviously it'd need to be refined, but the concept can) to help get the specifics of data. It can sense temperature, humidity, and even water levels.
